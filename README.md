This project detects audio deepfakes using machine learning, focusing on preprocessing audio files, extracting features (MFCCs, spectral features), and classifying them as genuine or fake. It uses Python libraries like Librosa, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. The system processes datasets into spectrograms for training and evaluates performance with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing, training, testing, and predictions.
